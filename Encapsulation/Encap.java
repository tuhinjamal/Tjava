// there are four core concept in oop 
/*
1. Encapsulation : a process of packing variables and methods into a single unit.  
2. Inheritance   : 
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction

there are four types of access modifier in java
1. private
2. default
3. protected
4. public


Enacapsulation benifits: 
1. packing variables and method into a single unit 
2. protecting data by declaring them as private 
   private data will be hidden from other classes and they can only be 
   accessed through the methods of their current class . 
   this is known as data hiding
3. resuability
4. code can be modify without breaking the code 
5. maintainance : hiding implementation details reduces complexity 

how to do encapsulation ?
1. declare the variables as private 
2. provide public setter and getter method to modify and get the variables value
